# QuranAudio

This repository contains the Audio Recitations of the Holy Quran.

For more info, see: [Quran API](https://quranapi.pages.dev)

It would be good to make a chron job github actions runner that checks known sources for mp3 files for download and commits them to this repo there is a chron job that does something similar in Mosques in the UK perhaps even for the fork of this repo too we would not like that needless data is downloaded
